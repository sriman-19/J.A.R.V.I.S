# JARVIS: Personal AI Assistant

JARVIS is an advanced personal assistant designed to automate tasks, provide information, and enhance productivity. This project integrates various functionalities like face recognition, voice commands, and task management to create a smart virtual assistant.

## Features

### Core Functionalities
1. **Face Recognition:**
   - Ensures secure access by verifying user identity using face recognition.
   - Unauthorized access prompts a warning, while authorized access allows full functionality.

2. **Voice Commands:**
   - Enables interaction using natural language for tasks like web searches, task scheduling, and controlling media.

3. **Task Automation:**
   - Open applications, search the web, manage schedules, and more with simple voice commands.

4. **Screen Scanning and AI Assistance:**
   - Scans the screen for text using OCR and queries AI models like Gemini for solutions or code generation.

5. **Spotify Control:**
   - Automate song selection and playback on Spotify.

6. **Internet Speed Test:**
   - Measures upload and download speeds with a voice-activated command.

7. **Alarm and Schedule Management:**
   - Set alarms and maintain a daily task schedule.

8. **Question Solver and Code Writer:**
   - Scan, solve questions, and generate programming code using AI.

9. **Autotyper:**
   - Simulates human-like typing for programming and text input.

10. **Fun and Utility Commands:**
    - Play games, take screenshots, capture photos, and interact conversationally.

### Security Features
- Periodic face scanning every 30 seconds for unauthorized users.
- Warning messages upon detecting unauthorized users.

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x installed on your system.
- Required Python libraries:
  - `pyttsx3`, `speech_recognition`, `pyautogui`, `pytesseract`, `opencv-python`, `DeepFace`, `plyer`, `pygame`, `spotipy`, `requests`, `beautifulsoup4`, and `pillow`.

### Setup Instructions
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/jarvis.git
   cd jarvis
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   Install all required libraries using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Setup Tesseract OCR:**
   - Download and install Tesseract OCR from [Tesseract OCR](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract).
   - Update the path to the Tesseract executable in the code:
     ```python
     pytesseract.pytesseract.tesseract_cmd = r'C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR\tesseract.exe'
     ```

4. **Configure AI Keys:**
   - Replace placeholders in the code (e.g., Gemini API key) with your actual API keys.

5. **Run the Application:**
   Execute the main script:
   ```bash
   python Main.py
   ```
