WEEK13_1- The Knuth Morris-Pratt algorithm -DAA:

Pattern Matching in DNA Sequences Using KMP Algorithm

In a DNA research project, you are given a long DNA sequence (text) and a smaller DNA sequence (pattern) that you want to search for within the long sequence. DNA sequences are
represented as strings consisting of the characters ‘A’, 'C', 'G', and 'T’.

Write a program that uses the Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) algorithm to find all occurrences of the pattern within the text. Your program should output the starting indices of each occurrence of the
pattern in the text.

Input:

1. Astring text, representing the DNA sequence to be searched.

2. Astring pattern, representing the DNA sequence pattern to search for in the text.

Output:

. Alist of integers representing the starting indices of each occurrence of the pattern in the text. If the pattern does not occur in the text, return an empty list.

Constraints:

. The length of text is up to 10610*6106 characters.

. The length of pattern is up to 10510*5105 characters.

. Both text and pattern consist of only the characters 'A’, 'C', 'G', and 'T’.

Example Input 1:

text = "ACGTACGTGACG"
pattern = "ACG" AQ
Example Output 1:

[0, 4, 9]
